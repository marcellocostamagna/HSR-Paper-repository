## Description

This folder contains scripts for experiments designed to test HSR ability to dicriminate between enantiomers. The experiments are divided into two categories: *organic chirality*, comparing 9 enantiomeric pairs of organic molecules, and *inorganic chirality*, comparing the lambda and delta enantiomer of a propeller-like metal complex

## Instructions

### Organic chirality 

Run the command:

```bash
python organic_chirality.py
```

### Inorganic chirality

*HSR* 

Run the command:

```bash
python inorganic_chirality.py
```

*CSR* 

Run the command:

```bash
python CSR.py
```

*USR:OptIso* 

Run the command:

```bash
python USR_Optiso.py
```
