## Description

This folder contains scripts for experiments designed to show HSR comparisons, with different ND molecular representations, of size-increasing molecules differing by different features. Specifically: isotope 'labeling' and amine protonation.

## Instructions


Run the command:

```bash
python features_effect.py
```

The script will generate two files:

- similarity_&_distances.svg: the `.svg` picture of the plots.
- similarity_scores.txt: a collection of all the similarity scores for the different comparisons
