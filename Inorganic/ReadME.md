## Description

This folder contains scripts for experiments designed to show HSR ability to compare inorganic and organometallic molecules. 
Three pairs of molecules are compared with the methods: *HSR*, *USR* and *USRCAT*.

Ther is also a script to showcase the dependency of USRCAT on molecular connectivity. 

## Instructions

*HSR*

Run the command:

```bash
python inorganic_molecules_HSR.py
```

*USR and USRCAT*

Run the command:

```bash
python inorganic_molecules_USR.py
```

*USRCAT's connectivity dependency*

```bash
python USRCAT_connectivity_dependency.py
```
